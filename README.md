# **StarBarako**

StarBarako is a Python Pygame project that simulates the experience of running a Filipino-themed cafe. In this cafe-style minigame, the player takes on the role of a student who returns to their home province to manage their grandfather's old Filipino-style cafe. The game features classic Filipino pastries, milk coffee, and other local delicacies that players must serve to customers within a time limit. The game also incorporates mini-games and challenges that test the player's ability to manage a cafe, handle customer demands, and keep up with the pace of a bustling business. With its immersive gameplay, charming graphics, and authentic Filipino theme, StarBarako is a fun and engaging way to experience the culture and cuisine of the Philippines.

This is one of my initial attempts in learning how to create a game using PyGame. Since I'm still inexperienced, there might be errors, bugs, or things that needs to be improved or changed in this game, I hope you could point those out by sending me a message, either through github or my email [echevariajohnleo@gmail.com](mailto:echevariajohnleo@gmail.com).<br>
**Thank you~!**
