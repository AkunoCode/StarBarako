# StarBarako: Filipino-themed Minigame (Pygame)

![StarBarako Game Snippet](https://github.com/AkunoCode/StarBarako/assets/109233177/f154153a-ca43-4fd1-9e1e-6a22415a2a9d)

StarBarako is a Python Pygame project that simulates the experience of running a Filipino-themed cafe. In this cafe-style minigame, the player takes on the role of a student who returns to their home province to manage their grandfather's old Filipino-style cafe. The game features classic Filipino pastries, drinks, and other local delicacies that players must serve to customers within a time limit of the game.

This is one of my initial attempts in learning how to create a game using PyGame. Since I'm still inexperienced, there might be errors, bugs, or things that needs to be improved or changed in this game, specially because it is still on development.

**Thank you~!**
